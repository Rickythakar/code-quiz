Code quiz for Coding BootCamp
This is a code quiz for the coding bootcamp that I am working on.
There are several comments within the function breaking down the different components of the function making the js file easy to read.
The quiz is a timed application that will ask multiple choice questions and reward more time for answering the question correctly.


The application will also come with a highscore table to view the top scorers.

The application will be deployed at the following live link.

A screenshot will be available when the project is finished.
